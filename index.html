  <section id="questions">
    <h2>Have a Question?</h2>
    <p><strong>In person –</strong> All volunteers will be wearing a red lanyard</p>
    <p><strong>Online –</strong> All questions may be directed to Kevin Stubbs and Androu Abdalmalak (<a href="mailto:kstubbs5@uwo.ca">kstubbs5@uwo.ca</a>, <a href="mailto:androu@nirx.net">androu@nirx.net</a>). Please include us both to ensure a prompt response.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="directions">
    <h2>Street Directions</h2>
    <p>All core events will take place in the <strong><a href="#https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/about/wirb.html">Western Interdisciplinary Research Building (WIRB)</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>If you are taking a taxi or other ride-share, then "Western Interdisciplinary Research Building" will be sufficient for them to find their way.</p>
    <p>Note that most of campus shares a street address and postal code (a source of constant issues) so you will need to use the name of the building instead.</p>

    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>Day passes have already been sent out to those who requested them. We recommend printing them so that you have more options in where/how you can park.</p>

    <p><strong>Unfortunately, these passes are not valid for the parking lot directly beside WIRB.</strong></p>
    <p>Note that guest parking on campus is limited so you should plan your route and arrive early. Parking may be especially limited on Wednesday and Thursday due to convocation.</p>

  <section id="wifi">
    <h2>Wi-Fi</h2>
    <p>a.	Eduroam is the easiest method for anyone from an institution that supports it (should be most)</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can select the guest network and enter a uwo email as your sponsor. Then the sponsor needs to approve. The default duration is quite short, so the sponsor also needs to extend it form their browser. We suggest making friends with the Western folks around you as Kevin and Androu may be slow to approve requests sent to them</p>
