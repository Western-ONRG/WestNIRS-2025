  <section id="directions">
    <h2>Street Directions</h2>
    <p>All core events will take place in the Western Interdisciplinary Research Building (WIRB) (Google map at bottom of linked page).</p>
    <p>If you are taking a taxi/Uber/etc., then "Western Interdisciplinary Research Building" will be sufficient for them to find their way.</p>
    <p>Note that most of campus shares a street address and postal code (a source of constant issues) so you will need to use the name of the building instead.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="parking">
    <h2>Parking</h2>
    <p>Day passes have already been sent out to those who requested them. We recommend printing them so that you have more options in where/how you can park.</p>
    <p>See <strong>WestNIRS-2025_Parking-Instructions.pdf</strong></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, these passes are not valid for the parking lot directly beside WIRB.</p>
    <p>Note that guest parking on campus is limited so you should plan your route and arrive early. Parking may be especially limited on Wednesday and Thursday due to convocation.</p>
